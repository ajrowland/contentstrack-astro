## ðŸš€ About

Scripts to generate football (Soccer!) entries in Contentstack.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command               | Action                                |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `bun install`         | Installs dependencies                 |
| `bun run addteams`    | Adds teams from Open Football Data    |
| `bun run addfixtures` | Adds fixtures from Open Football Data |

I've used Bun, but you can use NPM/Node.
